# Sonnet 1
by Kristoff Malejczuk

How shocked am I to feel the Sun's sharp rays, <br>
Perplexed I question where did Winter go? <br>
My world stands still as seasons waltz unfazed, <br>
No angel's plea can cause the Earth to slow. <br>

Have I a right to curse the passing time? <br>
This planet spins as even mountains hush, <br>
And watching them I see I too will die: <br>
Oh Time, why must you be in such a rush? <br>

Despite her power, Time was given no ears, <br>
The fault not hers, her blindness is not cruel. <br>
I see this now and stand to wipe my tears; <br>
Those born into this game don't make the rules. <br>

The path lies clear; if Time stops not to breathe, <br>
Go forth and fight -- at least she must be seized! <br>
