## The Studio

This was written on my 23rd birthday. After going for a run, my hidden exhaustion was revealed and I was preparing to go to bed early. But before I did, I knew I had to write this poem. I was compelled, driven to write it.

This poem is a reflection upon original thought and the cognitive environment in which it occurs, the studio.
