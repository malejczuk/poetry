The Tao (or) The Bathing Hole
2022/04/22

Strong currents flooded me from San Francisco.

I rode the wave, keen to be carried along.
The water brought me to a bathing hole
	clean and pure,
		but shallow.

A timid flow at first,
	the water hopefully tickled me
		and with time
	its timid trickle
			grew to a gentle current.

I bathed and the water carressed me in return.
	Loving and healing,
	 fresh and cleansing.
	
It was the most lovely bath.

And recently,
 	(ever so recently)
	(without me even noticing)
		the water began to pull me along.
And when I open my eyes,
	I see that I am moving.

		And before long
					I won't be where I am.
	The water is pulling me along
back to where I used to be.

			And me?
	I like where I am
			in this place that I soon won't be.
		And what's more?	
	Well,
			the bathing hole likes me.

Yet I do not fight.
(I know enough not to)
	I do nothing but float
		as I let the water carry me
				to where I'm supposed to go.
