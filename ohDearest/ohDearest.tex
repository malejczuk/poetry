\poemtitle{Oh Dearest}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{You are pried, plucked from your place}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Oh dearest, how selfless you are \\
Subjected since inception \\
To Helios' unforgiving stare \\
Sleeping every night in a bed of dirt \\!

Though you are provided for \\
Maslow's lowest level satisfied \\
You know nothing of freedom \\
Surviving in a suspended state \\!

One of Gaia's sick punchlines \\
In spite of your shackles \\
You blossom into a luscious flower \\
A universe unto yourself \\!

Flourishing, nourished and closely controlled, \\
You are prized and pried and plucked \\
Your fragile skin stripped \\
Leaving you with nothing but your soul \\!

You are trapped in a crystal cage \\
Luring all longing eyes to linger \\
And exposed for the world to see \\
Without revealing the secrets of your essence \\!
% But of your essence these greedy glares know nothing \\!

And I, nestled in naïveté \\
Bravely think I can save you \\
But my ballooned righteousness pops at a pinprick \\
As my thirst is no different than the Devil's \\!

I take you home \\
And my lust intensifies \\
As I treat you to a change of clothes \\
You draw me closer in bare attire \\!

Your scent is a rainforest \\
Filled with valleys and trees and fog \\
My desire overpowers my restraint \\
And we plunge into an ecstatic kiss \\!

I explore your curves for the first time \\
Your tongue coats mine in leather and nectar and gold \\
Yes, this is what I am living for \\
Oh dearest, how innocent and helpless you are \\!
\end{verse}
