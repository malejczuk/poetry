\poemtitle{Oh Dearest}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{You are pried, plucked from your place}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

Oh dearest, how selfless you are \\
Subjected since inception \\
To Helios' unmitigated wrath \\
Sleeping every night in a bed of dirt \\!

Thought you were provided for \\
Maslow's lowest level satisfied \\
You know nothing of freedom \\
Surviving in a suspended state \\!

One of Gaia's sick punchlines \\
In spite of you shackles \\
You blossomed into a luscious flower \\
A universe unto yourself \\!

Not so fast, for you have not won \\
You are pried, plucked from your place \\
Your fragile skin is stripped \\
Leaving you with nothing but your soul \\!

Exposed for the world to see \\
You are trapped in a crystal cage \\
Luring longing eyes to linger \\
But of your essence these greedy glares know nothing \\!

And I, nestled in naïveté \\
Think that I can save you \\
My ballooned righteousness pops at a pinprick \\
For my thirst is no different than the Devil's \\!

I take you home \\
And my lust intensifies \\
As I treat you to a change of clothes \\
Scantily clad you draw me closer \\!

Your scent is a rainforest \\
Rilled with valleys and trees and fog \\
My desire overpowers my restraint \\
As we plunge into an ecstatic kiss \\!

I feel your curves for the first time \\
As your tongue coats mine in leather and nectar and gold \\
Yes, this is what I am living for \\
Oh dearest, how selfless you are \\!
