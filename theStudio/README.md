## The Studio

This poem is a reflection upon original thought and the cognitive environment in which it occurs, the studio.

I wrote this poem on my 23rd birthday. After going for a run in the evening after finishing work, my hidden exhaustion was revealed and I was preparing to go to bed early. But before I did, I had the utter compulsion to express these ideas in a poem.
