\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

My mind is unwritten music \\
And a million notes played at once: \\
% Empty and filled to the brim \\
A blank stave overflowing. \\
And in this chaotic emptiness \\
Lies the melody that seeks to be found! \\!

Not merely a blank canvas \\
Nor a concealed masterpiece, smothered in grime; \\
An unobserved quantum state, \\
It is both at once! \\
\textit{I paint as I dust.} \\!

This is the studio \\
And in the studio I am free \\
To twist and turn and bob and weave! \\
I would come here often \\
But it's not often that I have the key. \\!

\end{verse}
