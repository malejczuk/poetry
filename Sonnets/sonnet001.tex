\medskip

How shocked am I to feel the Sun's sharp rays, \\
Perplexed I question where did Winter go? \\
My world stands still as seasons waltz unfazed, \\
No angel's plea can cause the Earth to slow. \\!

Have I a right to curse the passing time? \\
This planet spins as even mountains hush, \\
And watching them I see I too will die: \\
Oh Time, why must you be in such a rush? \\!

Despite her power, Time was given no ears, \\
The fault not hers, her blindness is not cruel. \\
I see this now and stand to wipe my tears; \\
Those born into this game don't make the rules. \\!

The path lies clear; if Time stops not to breathe, \\
Go forth and fight -- at least she must be seized!

\end{verse}
