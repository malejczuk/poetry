I climb the icy mountain
A sweet ascent in the endless white
Broken only by scattered rocks
Which I navigate effortlessly

I seek the summit
In a constant state of sugar high
I taste that the end is —
Avalanche!

I tumble down the sheer face
My back torn by the jagged dark stones
I lie face-up in the melting snow
Wrestling with what’s to come

But I mustn’t wait long
For a shadow to cover the sun
As a giant mouth appears
Swallowing me and the mountain whole
